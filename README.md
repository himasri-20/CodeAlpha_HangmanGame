# CodeAlpha_HangmanGame

## Project Description
This is a simple **text-based Hangman game** developed in Python as part of the CodeAlpha internship. The player has to guess the hidden word one letter at a time, with a maximum of **6 incorrect guesses** allowed.
Built using Python basics: random, while loops, if-else, strings, and lists.
# Hangman Game - CodeAlpha Internship Task

## Features
- Uses a **predefined list of 5 words**.
- Randomly selects a word for each game.
- Limits incorrect guesses to **6 chances**.
- Simple **console-based game** (no graphics or sound).
- Implements Python concepts like:
  - `random` module
  - `while` loop
  - `if-else` conditions
  - Strings and Lists

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**

## How to Run the Project
1. Make sure you have **Python 3.x** installed on your system.

## Purpose of the Project
The Hangman Game is designed to:
- Strengthen understanding of **Python basics** (loops, conditions, lists, and strings).
- Teach **game logic** and **input validation**.
- Demonstrate **problem-solving and algorithm design**.
- Serve as a **beginner-level portfolio project** for internships and interviews.
- Showcase ability to **build interactive console-based applications**.
